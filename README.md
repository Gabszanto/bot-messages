# Slack Bot Messages Templates    [![SlugBay Badge](https://www.slugbay.com/pictures/badges/slugbay-simple.svg)](https://www.slugbay.com)



A list of **bot messages templates** for Slack.  


I initially designed some of them for our integration of [SlugBay](https://www.slugbay.com) in Slack.  
It complements the existing resources in the [Slack Messaging documentation](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-formatting). 

**Enjoy!**

Make sure to also check our [Slack Welcome Bot](https://github.com/slugbay/slack-welcome-bot). It allows you allow you to hook into the real time API of Slack and perform a greeting to every new joiner automatically! âœ¨
